<h1>CSS </h1>
<body>
    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style and design the appearance of web pages. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements, making websites look more attractive and user-friendly. CSS can be applied in three ways: inline ,  and external. It uses selectors like class  and ID  to target HTML elements for styling. Common CSS properties include color, font-size, margin, and background-color. Advanced layout tools like Flexbox and Grid make CSS even more powerful by allowing developers to create responsive and structured designs across different screen sizes.</p>
