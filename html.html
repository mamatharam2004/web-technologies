    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic building block of all websites. It is used to create the structure and layout of a web page. HTML does not involve programming; instead, it uses markup tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.Without HTML, web pages would not exist. It tells the browser what to display and how to display it. For example, you can use HTML to insert a picture, create a list of items, make text bold or italic, or add a button that links to another page.Every HTML document starts with a declaration <!DOCTYPE html> which tells the browser that it's an HTML5 document. Then, everything is enclosed within <html>...</html>. Inside this, the <head> section contains metadata like the page title, and the <body> section contains the content that is visible on the web page.</p>
